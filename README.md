# Testimonials Project

The most interesting thing about this project was using svg for the first time instead of an image of arrows (to change testimonials in this case). I also validated based on the score from 1 to 5 how many stars should be shown respectively. And the same for the rest of the data: photo, name and the testimony as such.
